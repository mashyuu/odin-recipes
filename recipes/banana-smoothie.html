    <h2>Description</h2>
    <b> A vegan banana smoothie is a creamy, dairy-free blend made from ripe bananas and plant-based ingredients. It typically includes a base of non-dairy milk such as almond, soy, or oat milk, and might be enhanced with other fruits, a splash of vanilla extract, or a handful of greens.
